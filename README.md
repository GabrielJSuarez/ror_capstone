## Getting Started

### Setup

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

Clone the repository to your local machine

$ `git clone https://github.com/GabrielJSuarez/ror_capstone`

Go to your directory

$ `cd ror_capstone`

Run in terminal [You must have Ruby installed on your system.]

$ `bundle install`

the command bundle install is important to install required gem for the game to start. After you finish type:

- To create the local database tables in Postgres you will need to have it configured locally and then run:

$ `rails db:create`

- To run migration files:

$ `rails db:migrate`

This will do the proper migrations for the database, after that you can run the server:

$ `rails server`

Open your browser to localhost

http://localhost:3000/

- Run tests:

$ `rspec`

$ `Rubocop lint`

$ `rubocop .`

### Github Actions

1. On your recently forked repo, enable the GitHub Actions in the Actions tab.
2. Create the `feature/branch` and push.
3. Start working on your milestone as usual.
4. Open a PR from the `feature/branch` when your work is done.
